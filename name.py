#title is a method/function
#method is an action that python can pearform on a peice of data
#changing cases can be good for recognising different name inputs. Your program might 
#want to accept "ada", "Ada", "ADA" as the same input
#the . that come after the variable tells the method to act on the variable so title needs to act on name
